        A <span class="medium">computer</span> is a <a href="">machine</a> that can be instructed to carry out sequences
        of arithmetic
        or logical
        operations
        automatically
        via computer <span class="easy">programming</span>. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets
        of
        operations, called
        programs.
        These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the
        hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation
        can be
        referred to as a computer <span class="medium">system</span>. This term may as well be used for a group of
        computers that are
        connected and
        work
        together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.
