    <h1>Chicken</h1>>

    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl.
    Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
    2018,[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[2]
    Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.
    Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
    period (4th–2nd centuries BCE)
